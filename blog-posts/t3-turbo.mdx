For a while now, we've been getting a lot of requests for including a CLI option to scaffold [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) into a monorepo so that you can share code between your web and mobile application.
We have turn these requests down due to the added complexity it would bring, and the fact that we do not want to prescribe how to run your monorepo. There are several tooling available for monorepos, including [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) and [NX](https://nx.dev). Then there's the new kid on the block, [turborepo](https://turborepo.org) which we recently migrated the `create-t3-app` repo into so that we could have our upcoming documentation site in the same repo as the CLI scaffolding tool.

But... I won't let y'all down entirely, so I decided to create a template repo that should help you setup a T3 monorepo. Presenting `create-t3-turbo`. I'll admit the name might be deceiving since it isn't a scaffolding tool like `create-t3-app` is, but instead just a template repo with all the pieces included without any options to pick and choose.

Apologies in advance, this post is going to be a bit long, so for everyone who just want to see the final result, you can browse the repo directly [here](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo). TL;DR, we are going to take an existing T3 app and split it into a monorepo using turborepo. After that, we'll add an Expo app to the monorepo and consume the tRPC API on both web and mobile. I'll break this process down into smaller pieces and commit accordingly, so that you can follow along as easy as possible.

> Note: Due to the fact that `next-auth` currently doesn't support `react-native`, and I do not want to prescribe _a way_ to solve this problem, I'll leave auth out entirely for this demo.

## Initializing your T3 App

For demonstration purposes, I'll start by creating a new T3 app, but you can of course use your existing one. I am going to be using tRPC v10, so we'll use the `next` version of `create-t3-app`. Since we're going to be turning this into a monorepo, I'll also showcase the ability to enter a scoped appname when using the CLI. I'll assume you are already in a git repository and I'll hold off on installing the dependencies until we have setup turborepo. Lastly, if you haven't already tried out the `next` version of the CLI, try it out. It is... BLAZINGLY FAST!:

```bash
npx create-t3-app@next apps/@acme/nextjs --noGit --noInstall
```

I'll select all packages except for `next-auth`.

At this point, you'll have a new T3 app in `apps/nextjs`, and if you check the `package.json`, you'll see that it got named `@acme/nextjs`. If you are using an existing app, just move it into the `apps/` sub-directory and scope-name it to something appropriate. Also clean out any temporary files, as well as your lockfile, we'll get all of those re-setup when we initialize turbo.

_Your repo should look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/9151258225518a1a44d7aa45c49f0b33ebb9933c) now._

## Initializing turbo

Now we'll install turbo and create some basic configuration files for it. Add the following configuration files into your project root, these are basic configuration files inspired by the turbo example apps:

- [package.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/package.json)
- [turbo.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/turbo.json)

Next, move the `.gitignore` from your T3 app into the project root, and add `.turbo`, `.expo` and `dist` to its ignored files. We'll also need a base `tsconfig` that we'll later inherit from. We'll use the `tsconfig.json` from the T3 app as base, and then inherit from this file in the T3 app:

- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/tsconfig.json)
- [apps/nextjs/tsconfig.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/apps/nextjs/tsconfig.json)

Now, install all the dependencies using your preffered package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

_Your repo should look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/208f2c8e0de03165e4fb23071f4df5b85628bd24) now._

## Extracting your prisma database client to it's own package

Let's start restructing this monorepo. We'll start off with extracting the prisma client to it's own package. This way, it is more reusable when you add more things which consumes it later.
We'll start off by creating a new package, `@acme/db` in `packages/db` with some basic configuration files:

- [package.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/db/package.json)
- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/db/tsconfig.json)

We'll move the `client` as well as the `prisma` models from the T3 App, you might also need to remove the `global` declaration.

```bash
mv apps/nextjs/src/server/db/client.ts packages/db/index.ts
mv apps/nextjs/prisma packages/db/prisma
```

You can now delete the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` dependencies in the T3 app, as well as the `postinstall` script.

> Note: We won't do type validation for environment variables in this subpackage, so remove the `env` import and use `process.env` instead. You can also remove the `DATABASE_URL` in the env-schema defined in the `env/schema.mjs`.

_Your repo should now look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/5f8117aaacc2713d2719e7d12b04d82d984d14fa)._

## Extracting your tRPC router to its own package

Next, we'll do a similar thing with our tRPC router and extract that out from the T3 app into its own package. This makes it so that we can share it between our different apps.

We'll initialize a new package, `@acme/api` in `packages/api` with some basic configuration files:

- [package.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/api/package.json)
- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/api/tsconfig.json)

Next, we'll move the tRPC router from the T3 app into this package:

```bash
mv apps/nextjs/src/server/trpc packages/api/src
```

We'll create a few barrel-files in the `api` package to make importing easier:

```ts:index.ts
export type { AppRouter } from "./src/router";
export { appRouter } from "./src/router";

export { createContext } from "./src/context";
export type { Context } from "./src/context";
```

```ts:transformer.ts
import superjson from "superjson";
export const transformer = superjson;
```

There are a few small bits that we need to modify now. First, we'll resolve some imports:

```ts:packages/api/src/context.ts
import { prisma } from "@acme/db";
```

```ts:apps/nextjs/src/utils/trpc.ts
import type { AppRouter } from "@acme/api";
import { transformer } from "@acme/api/transformer"; // <-- use this in `setupTRPC`
```

```ts:apps/nextjs/src/pages/api/trpc/[trpc].ts
import { appRouter, createContext } from "@acme/api";
```

Then, we'll add the `@acme/api` package as a dependency for the T3 App, and remove `superjson`. We'll also need to add `next-transpile-modules` as a dev-dependency in order to import the API. Transpile the `@acme/api` package in your `next.config.mjs` like this:

```ts:next.config.mjs
import withTM from "next-transpile-modules";

// ...

export default withTM(["@acme/api"])(
  defineNextConfig({ ... })
);
```

When you're done, your repo should look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/8550e4648b21d0edd037f98e256dcb089e530ae3).

Now you should be able to launch the application again. Run a `install` then start the dev-server.

If you don't want a mobile application, you can stop right here and call it a day. You have successfully separated your Next.js application from its tRPC router and Prisma client. However, one of the main arguments for splitting it up like this is so that you can consume the API in other applications so we'll do that next.

## Adding an Expo React Native application to the mix

Bootstrap the Expo application by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app apps/expo --template blank-typescript
```

You should be left with a React Native application using Typescript, React 18 with Expo SDK 46. Because we are using it in a monorepo, there are a few things we need to do in order to get it working.

In the `package.json`, change the main entrypoint, I'll also scope the package name to get it coherant with the rest of the repo as well as adding a `dev` script so that it launches in my preferred way along with the others:

```json:package.json
"name": "@acme/expo",
"main": "src/_app.tsx",
"scripts": {
  "dev": "expo start --ios", // depending on your use-case
  ...
}
...
```

Now we need to create this entrypoint, move the `App.tsx` to `src/_app.tsx` and add the following content:

```tsx:_app.tsx
import { registerRootComponent } from "expo";

const App = () => {
  ...
};

registerRootComponent(App);
```

You might have noticed earlier, that the dependency installation failed while creating the Expo app, so we'll run that manually from the project root.

```bash
npm install
```

I'll also add some nice-to-haves, although they are completely optional:

```bash
npm install @shopify/flash-list react-native-safe-area-context -w apps/expo
```

Expo might also have initialized its own Git repository, in that case we'll have to remove that:

```bash
rm -rf apps/expo/.git
```

> Note: As of writing this post, React Native only supports React 18.0.0. Make sure to match the versions in your Next.js application, or you'll get some errors when starting up. Clean the dependencies and remove the lockfile, and re-install once you have.

You should now be able to start the application. Running

```bash
npm run dev
```

should start up `Prisma Studio`, `Next.js` and `Expo`. Make some changes to the `App`'s content and you should see it refresh on the phone. We'll now move on to adding the other awesome T3 tech to this mobile application.

_Your repo should now look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/789f952256932033a03e57658f18b48ac7833945)_

### Adding Tailwind

To add styling using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to your Expo application, we'll be using a package called [Nativewind](https://nativewind.dev). It will allow us to style our React Native elements just like we would with any of the HTML DOM elements using the `className` attribute.

First, install the dependencies to the Expo project:

```bash
npm install nativewind -w apps/expo
npm install -D tailwindcss -w apps/expo
```

Copy over your tailwind config from the Next.js application. Alternatively you can abstract it into a separate `config` package and extend from that one.

```bash
cp apps/nextjs/tailwind.config.cjs apps/expo/tailwind.config.cjs
```

Then, in order to use tailwind directly on the elements without needing to wrap them in `styled()`, we'll use their Babel plugin. In your `babel.config.js`, add the following field:

```js:babel.config.js
plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
```

We'll also need to include the types to support the className keyword without getting a bunch of type-errors. Create a `types/nativewind.d.ts` file and add the following tripple-slash directive to it:

```ts:types/nativewind.d.ts
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
```

Now you're done and can use Tailwind classes just like normal. You'll even have the awesome Intellisense if you have the VSCode plugin installed.

_At this point, your repo should look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/6709d7f417474a82e83150a72a1ac73c62f02c26)._

### Consuming your tRPC API in Expo

Now, we'd want to call our tRPC API in our Expo application. We'll start by adding the necessary dependencies to the app:

```bash
npm install @trpc/client@experimental @trpc/server@experimental @trpc/react@experimental @tanstack/react-query @acme/api -w apps/expo
```

Setup the `trpc` object in `src/utils/trpc.ts`:

```ts:utils/trpc.ts
import { createTRPCReact } from "@trpc/react";
import type { AppRouter } from "@acme/api";

export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();
```

Next, we'll configure the `trpcClient` and `queryClient` in the `_app.tsx`:

```tsx:_app.tsx
import React from "react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import { trpc } from "./utils/trpc";
import { transformer } from "@acme/api/transformer";

const url = "http://localhost:3000/api/trpc";

const App = () => {
  const [queryClient] = React.useState(() => new QueryClient());
  const [trpcClient] = React.useState(() =>
    trpc.createClient({ url, transformer }),
  );

  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        ...
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
};
```

As a bonus, I'll refactor the screen's content out to `src/screens/Home.tsx`. You should be left with something like this:

```tsx:src/_app.tsx
import { registerRootComponent } from "expo";
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaProvider } from "react-native-safe-area-context";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import { trpc } from "./utils/trpc";
import { transformer } from "@acme/api/transformer";

import { HomeScreen } from "./screens/home";

const url = "http://localhost:3000/api/trpc";

const App = () => {
  const [queryClient] = React.useState(() => new QueryClient());
  const [trpcClient] = React.useState(() => trpc.createClient({ url, transformer }));

  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <SafeAreaProvider>
          <HomeScreen />
          <StatusBar />
        </SafeAreaProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
};

registerRootComponent(App);
```

```tsx:src/screens/home.tsx
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

export const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View className="flex flex-1 bg-white items-center justify-center">
      <Text className="font-bold text-blue-800">Home Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

If you launch the application at this point, you'll notice there are errors about `copy-anything` (used by `superjson`) not being resolved correctly. This is because metro doesn't resolve `.cjs` files by default, so we'll have to add support for this in order to support `superjson` transforming. Create a `metro.config.js` and add the following:

```js:metro.config.js
module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    /* resolver options */
    sourceExts: ["jsx", "js", "ts", "tsx", "cjs"],
  },
};
```

Your tRPC API is now setup and ready to be consumed. Before that, lets modify the router so we have something to display.

_At this point, your repo should look something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/61dc5cbb1ad67d6566fe7eb5208b694cb12dc304)._

### Making something pseudo-useful

You can most likely skip this step, in that case you can skip to the [final words](#final-words). Below I'll just show a mockup usage of how this all works together!

I'll make a blog-ish example here. Since this is highly personal, I'll just go over this briefly. I'll first modify my prisma model to include some basic data for a post:

```js:schema.prisma
model Post {
    id      String @id @default(cuid())
    title   String
    content String
}
```

Next, I'll fetch this data in a tRPC postRouter:

```ts:router/post.ts
export const postRouter = t.router({
  all: t.procedure.query(({ ctx }) => {
    return ctx.prisma.post.findMany();
  }),
  byId: t.procedure.input(z.string()).query(({ ctx, input }) => {
    return ctx.prisma.post.findFirst({ where: { id: input } });
  }),
});
```

For now, I'll just add a few example posts using Prisma Studio. The resulting repo looks something like [this](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/tree/af11f71f651e919e80038828fbb15b95f5886451), and we can now consume this on both the Next.js and Expo applications.

> Note: If you want to share components and navigation logic between your applications, check out [Solito](https://solito.dev). I however, believe these platforms are different enough that they should be treated differently, so I'll satisfy with just sharing my API logic, and write separate components and screens for each platform.

I'll create a PostCard in both React as well as React Native:

```tsx:apps/nextjs/src/pages/index.tsx
const PostCard: React.FC<{
  post: inferProcedureOutput<AppRouter["post"]["all"]>[number];
}> = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">{post.title}</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx:apps/expo/src/screens/Home.tsx
const PostCard: React.FC<{
  post: inferProcedureOutput<AppRouter["post"]["all"]>[number];
}> = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <View className="p-4">
      <Text className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">{post.title}</Text>
      <Text className="text-gray-600">{post.content}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

Next, we'll fetch the posts from our API and display them using these cards:

```tsx:apps/nextjs/src/pages/index.tsx
const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const postQuery = trpc.proxy.post.all.useQuery();

  return (
    ...
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center w-full pt-6 text-2xl text-blue-500">
      {postQuery.data ? (
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
          {postQuery.data?.map((p) => {
            return <PostCard post={p} />;
          })}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading..</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx:apps/expo/src/screens/Home.tsx
export const HomeScreen = () => {
  const postQuery = trpc.post.all.useQuery();

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View className="h-full w-full">
        <FlashList
          data={postQuery.data}
          estimatedItemSize={20}
          renderItem={(p) => <PostCard post={p.item} />}
        />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

And we're done! You should see your posts appearing on both applications, and if you add another one in the Prisma Studio, it will appear just like the others! Here is a screenshot of the final result:

## Final Words

Thank you for reading this post. This was my first ever post, so if you enjoyed it, go give the repo a [star](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/stargazers). If it helped you out, consider [buying me a coffee](https://github.com/sponsors/t3-oss), I would truly appreciate it!

Also, this blog is not finished yet, but I wanted to get this post up as soon as possible to satisfy the community demands. If you have any suggestions for how to improve it, feel free to get in touch!

> Note: I will go over the code once tRPC v10 is properly released to make sure it all still works. There might be API changes until then so there might be slight changes required depending on the time you're reading this.

What should I write about next?
